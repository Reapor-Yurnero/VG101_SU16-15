This is a template for students to complete your homework.
You should follow the instructions carefully.
Failing to do so WILL lead to deduciton.
The graceful period has past, guys and girls.
This file is also a sample README (without algorithm) for you.

USAGE:
First, READ THE CODE!
Write your corresponding exercise in ex1.c, ex2.c, etc.
Each file contains functions for the corresponding assignment.
These source file should always include "assignment.h"
Declare the function for your exercise in "assignment.h"
If the assignment contains less then 4 exercises,
Delete extra file. (And declaration in "assignment.h")

COMPILING:
For command line, run 

gcc -Wall main.c ex1.c ex2.c ex3.c ex4.c -o out

For IDE users:

CLion users please see CLion Usage guide.
Code::Blocks users look for "Add files" in the menu.
Mac OS users please find Yuni

RUNNING
Run your ouptut executable. Either (in command line) with

out.ext -exi

For exercise i, or (For IDEs) click "Run" then input the exercise number
(an integer) into program to run a specific exercise.

Extra information:
Keep assignment source files named in this form.
Meaning:
1) Readme file should be "README", no file extention, all case letter.
2) Each exercise named as "exi.c". all lower case letters.
3) Normally, upload source file ONLY. In rare cases if you need to upload something 
   that is not a source file. Clearly state that in your README!
