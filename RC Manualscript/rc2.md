## README: What are they and How to write them?
   * What is readme? Why write them?
       * README is a file that describes the programme.
       * It's duty is to convey information from the developer to the user
       * Tells user how to use your programme, what to input? What to expect
       * Writing good readme can help the user (YOUR TA!!!) use and understand your code
            * By doing so your are most likely to earn more points!
            * If your programmes fails, try analyzing the reason, identify the line of code that goes wrong, which will save you much points!
            * Good READMEs earn extra points!
       
   * What is typically contained in readme? 
   
   The following are used to provoke thinking. You clearly will not require all of them, even most of them
   
        * What is this programme? What for?

            * How to input and what is expected output?
            * Yes, it's your job to decide what form should the output be.
            * Are there any advanced usage? "Tricks" may be
        * What is required to run this programme?
            * A matlab programme obviously require matlab intalled.
            * Will you programme run on Windows? or Mac? or Both? 
            * Do your programme require the help of another programme to run?
        * What is the techinical highlights?
            * Why is this programme different as other?
            * Is this programme faster or slower?
            * Is this programme a proof of concept?
        * Are there anything the user should know? Limitations?
            * Maybe running this programme for too long would blow off the computer?
            * This programmes fails on certain input? Sometimes wrong answer for certain input.
            * What will happen if something goes wrong? What will hapen if `sqrt(-1)`
            * Will the programme work on 100 numbers? A thousand? A million?
        * Who to contact if the user need help? 
            * Your or your organization's contact info?
            * How to help you further develop the programme?
